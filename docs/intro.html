  <h1 style="color:white;">Method Riddle</h1>

  <p style="color:white;text-align:left;"><strong>As many other sciences, Archaeology is currently benefiting from the great increase of production of the last years all across different scientific disciplines. This, asides from bringing new archaeological data, also results in a large number of valuable theoretical and methodological proposals. However, they don't always reach the same conclusions, despite using similar data, and with this project we'd like to dive into metascience to find out why. Please, come along to find out more!!</strong></p>
